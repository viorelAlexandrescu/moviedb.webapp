# Moviedb.Webapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

# Web Application Configuration

We will create the frontend with a Angular project.
The web application is placed within the moviedb.webapp folder.

The project hierarchy will be:
*All new angular components will be placed within the components folder
*Every angular component should have it's own angular service, but they may share some global services.
*Every new application component shall be declared in the app.module.ts file, according to it's usage.
*Whatever data model we present on the backend shall be mirrored in the frontend, to the extent of it's usage.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
